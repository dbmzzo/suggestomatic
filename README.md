# Suggestomatic

Suggestomatic is a ruby-based twitter bot that responds to queries with small screenshots of Google's search suggestions for that query.

For example, the following tweet:

`@suggestomatic why are cats`

would result in the following response from @suggestomatic:

![why are cats](http://i.imgur.com/wBG0vwM.png)

## more details (and code comments) coming soon
